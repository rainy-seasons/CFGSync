# How to use
* Set `STEAM_ID` to the STEAM ID3 of the account that owns your 'main' config.
* You can find your STEAM_ID3 by using https://steamid.xyz/ or any of the other tools for finding your steam id.
* Set `STEAM_PATH` to your base install directory for Steam. The default is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`
* Run the script `python cfgsync.py` and let it sync the cfg on all of your other accounts to your desired config.
